Directory Shell Scrips have the files to be executed from the linux command line.
    1: Execute the server
    2: Here you have 2 files, one for player1 and another for player2
        You can execute both 1 time, or execute one of them 2 times to have 2 players.


This is a chat game with the following demands:

    Having a Player class - an instance of this class with that can communicate with other Player(s) (other instances of this class)

    The use case for this task is as bellow:

    1. create 2 players
    2. one of the players should send a message to second player
    3. when a player receives a message should send back a new message that contains the received message concatenated with the message counter that this player sent.
    4. finalize the program after the initiator sent 10 messages and received back 10 messages
    5. Show the complete message when game is over.

    Pure Java as much as possible (no additional frameworks like spring, etc.)
    Maven project with no jars.
    Shell script to start the program.
